Automated Crypto Market Tracking Every 6 Hours from Yahoo Finance with Python

## Project Description
This project automates the extraction of real-time cryptocurrency data, including coin name, price, change, change percentage, and volume, from Yahoo Finance every 6 hours over a 3-day period. The goal is to track market behavior and spot short-term trends. The script uses Python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, and seaborn to scrape, store, and visualize the data in a structured CSV file for ongoing analysis.

### The collected data is then analyzed to:

- Visualize price trends of top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum,â€¦

- Compare daily percentage changes across coins

- Identify average change patterns and trading volumes

- Analyze correlations between price, volume, and volatility
